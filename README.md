# Medial Entorhinal Cortex motif unit (using NerveFlow)

This project models a Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC) motif unit using the framewrok of NerveFlow. The aim is to demonstrate the bi-stable activity of the MEC motif unit consisting of a network of Stellate cells and Interneurons, comprised of an excitatory feedback.
